    <h1>Cold Yogurt Soup (Abdoogh Khiar)</h1>
    <img src="https://yummynotes.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/abdoogh-khiar-recipe.jpg" height="400px" alt="a bowl of abdogh khiar">
    <p>This refreshing soup, made with cooling ingredients and served icy cold, is the perfect light lunch on a hot day. I enjoy it all summer-and I always have the best naps after eating it. You can make the yogurt mixture ahead and keep it in the fridge and just dish out a bowl whenever you like. Though optional, the rose petals make it pretty and quintessentially Persian. You can usually find food-safe dried rose petals in Middle Eastern supermarkets.</p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>2 cups Greek-style yogurt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons crushed dried mint</li>
        <li>2 cups cold water, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 Persian cucumbers, diced</li>
        <li>¼ cup raisins</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh mint</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground dried Persian rose petals (Optional)</li>
        <li>ice cubes</li>
        <li>2 pita bread rounds, or to taste</li>
     </ul>
    
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>step 1</h3>
    <p>Puree yogurt, salt, and dried mint in a blender with enough of the water to create a smooth, thin soup. It will thicken some when you add the bread.</p>
    <h3>step 2</h3>
    <p>Divide the cucumbers, raisins, walnuts, and herbs among four bowls.</p>
    <h3>step 3</h3>
    <p>Pour one-fourth of the yogurt mixture into each bowl.</p>
    <h3>step 4</h3>
    <p>Top with rose petals, and add a few ice cubes to each bowl.</p>
    <h3>step 5</h3>
    <p>Tear bread into small pieces and add some to each bowl. Let bread soak 5 to 7 minutes before serving. Serve cold.</p>
